# Astelia: Graph Visualizer


## About the Author

Hello! My name is Shotade Aminat. I’m a Senior Frontend Engineer with over six years of experience building efficient, modular, and scalable user interfaces. 

I’ve led projects like Avicash, NSIB, and Trips, focusing on performance, maintainability, and seamless integration of multiple services. My background in React, React Native, and design systems aligns well with BPMN-like process orchestration—mapping well to the concept of visually modeling and reusing components for clarity and maintainability. 

I’m passionate about creating dynamic, connected interfaces that support teams and users alike. If you have any questions or want to chat about frontend, process modeling, or software architecture, feel free to reach out!


A Next.js application featuring a dashboard UI, built with the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) component library, React Flow (for network graphs), and Tailwind CSS.

## **Project Overview**

Astelia is a dashboard for visualizing networks, assets, contextual risk, and more. It includes:
- A collapsible sidebar for navigation (Dashboard, Alerts, Assets, Network, etc.)
- A central area for graph visualization (React Flow / XYFlow).
- Various panels (Risk Summary, Contextual Risk, Description, etc.) to display relevant data.

This is still work in progress, with placeholders for the majority of pages except the “Dashboard” module.

## **Folder Structure**

Below is a simplified tree of the most important folders/files

Here's what we'll be looking at:

- Component organization and reusability
- Clean and maintainable CSS implementation
- State management approach
- TypeScript usage and type safety
- Overall code structure and readability

## Tech Stack

We've set up the project with some modern tools to help you get started quickly:

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling
- **React Flow** - Graph visualization library
- **shadcn/ui** - Component library
- **TypeScript** - For type safety

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser


### Key Folders:

- **`app/(dashboard)/…`**: Contains all route segments for the main dashboard (e.g. `/alerts`, `/assets`, etc.).  
- **`components/`**: Reusable React components, including the sidebar, custom panels, etc.  
- **`components/ui/`**: This is **automatically generated** by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Do **not** manually edit these unless you’re customizing. Re-run the shadcn CLI to add or update them.

## **Using ShadCN UI**

We use [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) to rapidly scaffold common components (Cards, Buttons, Dialogs, etc.) using Tailwind CSS. Files under `components/ui/`:

- Are generated by the **shadcn** CLI.  
- Contain prebuilt components tailored to the shadcn design system.  
- If you need a new component (e.g., Accordion, Tooltip, etc.), run:
  ```bash
  npx shadcn-ui add accordion

### Additional Notes
- **Placeholder Pages**: All pages except / (Dashboard) are placeholders that render simple text (“Alerts,” “Assets,” etc.). They can be fleshed out later.
- **Custom Sidebar**: The collapsible sidebar uses a SidebarProvider (from shadcn or custom) plus a SidebarTrigger/CustomTrigger button. Check out components/side-menu/Sidebar.tsx for the main logic.
- **React Flow or XYFlow**: For node-based graph visualization, see GraphVisualization.tsx** (or app/(dashboard)/GraphVisualization.tsx).
- **Theming**: We rely on Tailwind and HSL color variables. For theming changes, see tailwind.config.js and globals.css.
**Error Boundaries**: We have a simple error boundary to catch unexpected client-side errors (still in progress).
